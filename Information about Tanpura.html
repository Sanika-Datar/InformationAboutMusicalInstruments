Tanpura, also known as Tambura, is a long-necked fretless Indian lute. It supplies accompaniment for both classical and folk music of South Asia, and it provides an essential tonal foundation from which a singer or instrumental soloist develops the raga (musical moods). It is a well-known fact that generally the best sounding Tanpuras in India come from a place called Miraj in Maharashtra.

 The body shape of the Tanpura somewhat resembles that of the sitar but it has no frets - as the strings are always  plucked at their full lengths. One or more Tanpuras may be used to accompany vocalists or instrumentalists. It has four or five (rarely six) metal strings, which are plucked one after another in a regular pattern to create a harmonic resonance on the basic notes of a key.
