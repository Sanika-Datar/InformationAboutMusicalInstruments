Harmonium is an instrument that has its origins in the period of British Rule in India. It is a modified version of reed organ, with keys like piano and bellows to pump air into the instrument. Harmonium is widely used as an accompaniment in Hindustani Classical Music, but is primarily the sole instrument for religious congregational singing called 'Bhakti' or 'Kirtan'.

There are two types of harmoniums mainly hand-pumped harmoniuma and foot-pumped harmonium. Nowadays, mostly hand-pumped harmonium are used. In a hand-pumped harmonium, the player pushes and pulls a handle back and forth with one hand, which is joined to the bellows that blows the air. Because of this, he or she can only use one hand to play the keys	as the other has to keep pumping the bellows. Some players can pump enough air with one hand, and then play the keys with both hands, when necessary.
