The head of each drum has a central area of "tuning paste" called the Syahi. Syahi is common in many drums of Indian origin. This method allows these drums to produce harmonic overtones and is responsible for their unique sounds. Syahi is constructed using multiple layers of paste made from starch (wheat or rice) mixed black powder of various origins. The precise construction and shaping of this area is responsible for modification of drums natural overtones, resulting in clarity of pitch.
