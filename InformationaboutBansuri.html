Bansuri is a side blown flute originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is a very sensitive instrument; almost all the delicate graces, curves, embellishments and shades of classical music can be played on this instrument. The highest order of music can be performed to perfection upon it. The higher order of music can be played on this instrument, and its resonance in mandra saptak (lower octave) leaves a rare charm in the minds of its listeners. Being a portable instrument, it can be carried easily from place to place and climate changes have a very little or no effect on the seasoned bamboo.
